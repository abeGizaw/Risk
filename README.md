# Risk Game Implementation
This is a Java-based implementation of the classic board game Risk, developed as a project for a Software Quality Assurance class. The project emphasizes rigorous software development practices and quality assurance techniques.  


## About the Game
Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict, and conquest. The game is played on a board depicting a political map of the Earth, divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents. The primary objective of the game is to occupy every territory on the board and eliminate all other players.

## Key Features
- **BVA (Boundary Value Analysis)**
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Mocking**
- **Code Coverage Analysis**
- **Extensive Testing**

## How to Play

Players take turns to:
1. **Deploy** - Receive and place armies on territories.
2. **Attack** - Battle to occupy territories (using dice rolls to determine the outcome).
3. **Maneuver** - Move armies between adjacent territories.

## Winning the Game

The winner is the player who eliminates every other player and controls all territories on the board.

## Project Contributions

- Designed and implemented core game functionalities and mechanics.
- Applied TDD practices for robust code development.
- Ensured high code quality and test coverage across the codebase.
- Injected dependencies for better modularity and testing.
- Utilized mocking to simulate complex scenarios and interactions.
